# Cicada---Student-Management-System
Cicada - Student Management System streamlines student data management by integrating Python with MySQL. It offers secure admin login, enabling efficient storage, access, and management of student records.

Before running the project, ensure that all prerequisites are met. Install **MySQL Server** from the official website and set up the **MySQL Python Connector** to enable the connection between Python and MySQL. Additionally, install the Python MySQL library using the command: `pip install mysql-connector-python`. Once installations are complete, configure the script by updating the `host`, `user`, and `passwd` values to match your MySQL server credentials. For instance: `mydb = mysql.connector.connect(host="your_host", user="your_username", passwd="your_password")`. These steps ensure a seamless connection between Python and MySQL for the project.
